Case
A medium sized company - "Lofthus frukt og saft" located at Hardanger fjord in western Norway - are producing one of the best apple juices in Norway. It is a 100% pure natural product, without any sugar added or other additives of any kind.

Until now they were mostly present at the local market in western Norway, but they have ambitions to expand and find new markets. As a part of this process they need a new website. The main purpose for the website will be to promote and sell their products. Also, information about the company and their production processes will be an important part of the website.

You have been asked by "Lofthus frukt og saft" to create the online website, including all the necessary content (identity elements, articles, photos etc.). At this moment they have just a logo and a simple brand strategy without any visual assets to use in the website production.

This is a big and complicated project that needs good planning and professionals from different fields to accomplish a task at this scale. As the first part of this project you should create a detailed Gantt chart plan showing all the crucial activities to accomplish the project. As you can see, this project includes different tasks and some of them are out of your competence. This means that you need to engage various professionals from different fields.

Your Gantt chart at the minimum should include the following:

What the various activities are
When each activity begins and ends
How long each activity is scheduled to last
Where activities overlap with other activities, and by how much
The start and end date of the whole project
Who is responsible for which activity (e.g. copywriter, photographer, front-end developer, etc.)
Key meetings with customer and presentations
Level 1 Process
Analyze the case and consider all the different elements that should be produced for a fully functional website. (e.g. text, content, visual elements, code, etc.)
Outline all the tasks and plan in what order they should be completed
Think about what other professionals you need to engage for this project and how would you collaborate with them and share, for example, project files.
Create a Gantt chart for your project including all the different activities and tasks.
Write a report (500-1000 words) explaining your work process and justifying your choices. Explain how you would communicate with your client and other team members. What communication tools would you use to accomplish this project? Don't forget to also include considerations towards intellectual property here in terms of earning and protecting your IP.
Upload your Gantt chart to your GitHub repository, and add the link to your report. Pay attention to the conventions for file naming. Include a link to your repository in your report and ensure the repo is set to public.
Invite your tutor as a collaborator to your repository on GitHub to see the result and give feedback
